#Using Data from Accelerometers to Predict the Correct Way of Doing Exercises

This is an educational project, which is the part of [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) provided by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

## Introduction

Using personal sport devices it is now possible to collect large amount of 
data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people 
regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they 
rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, we will study how to 
predict if a barbell lifted correctly or incorrectly using data from 
accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, that
were asked to perform in 5 different ways [1]. 

## Data

The dataset was kindly provided by [Cousera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Groupware@LES](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). Data can be downloaded here: [train dataset](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv), [test dataset](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv).
