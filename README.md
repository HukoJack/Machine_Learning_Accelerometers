#Using Data from Accelerometers to Predict the Correct Way of Doing Exercises

## Synopsis

Using personal sport devices it is now possible to collect a large amount of 
data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people 
regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they 
rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, we will study how to 
predict if a barbell lifted correctly or incorrectly using data from 
accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, that
were asked to perform in 5 different ways. 


The dataset was kindly provided by [Groupware@LES](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).
